In Matrix_StressUnitTest.cpp, it computes matrix multiplication for 1,000,000 times, the result will 
show how much time it takes to finish all of them. 
For collision detection, the game will be run for 30 seconds, the result will show the average execution 
time for the function. The number of function's execution is also printed. Visual Studio's sampling profiler 
will also be run for 30 seconds.

SIMD version:
matrix stress test: 128598.000000 ticks(46.896130 ms)
Non-SIMD version: 
matrix stress test: 168900.000000 ticks(61.593151 ms)

SIMD version:
Average collision detection(340938 times): 3.928380 ticks(0.001094 ms)
3.2% time is spend on CollisionDetection according to Visual Studio's profiler
Non-SIMD version:
Average collision detection(331848 times): 4.191401 ticks(0.001459 ms)
3.3% time is spend on CollisionDetection according to Visual Studio's profiler
